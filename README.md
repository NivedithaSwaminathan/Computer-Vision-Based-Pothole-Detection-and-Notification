# Computer-Vision-Based-Pothole-Detection-and-Notification
Blob detection algorithm used to detect potholes on the road.

The entire system has been built using a Raspberry Pi, a Pi Camera and a GPS module. A detailed description can be found in the paper(link provided).

detect.py is the Python code used for detecting potholes from road images, collecting the coordinates of the pothole, sending email and logging information into the database.
